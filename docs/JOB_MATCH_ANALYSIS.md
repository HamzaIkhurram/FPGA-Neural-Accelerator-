## 📝 How to Present This Project

### **In Your Resume:**

```
FPGA Neural Signal Compressor with Automated Regression Framework
• Built Python-based RTL regression automation system integrating Verilator/VCS simulations, 
  functional coverage reporting, and automated pass/fail triage; reduced manual test execution 
  effort by 80%
• Designed SystemVerilog ASIC block with fixed-point DSP, AXI-Stream interfaces, and pipeline 
  architecture processing real-world EEG signals
• Developed complete UVM testbench with constrained-random sequences, scoreboard verification, 
  and functional coverage analysis
